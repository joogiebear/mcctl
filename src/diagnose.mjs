 * what is wrong, and what do I do about it. Every shape here is a failure with a known
 * cause and a known way out; anything else stays a stack trace, honestly, rather than
 * being guessed at.
 *
 * <p>Pure over an array of lines, so every shape is testable without a server. The callers
 * decide where the lines come from: the panel and CLI tail the captured console, the
 * daemon keeps a ring of its child's last output for the moment it dies.
